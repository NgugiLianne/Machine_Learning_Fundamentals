Nearest Neighbor Classification Project
Overview
This project implements nearest neighbor classification algorithms using both L1 and L2 distances from a Machine Learning Fundamentals course in Edx. Course Staff Instructor Sanjoy Dasgupta, Professor, Computer Science and Engineering Department, UC San Diego.
It aims to classify data points into different classes based on their similarities to training data.
It ains to sharpen the ability to program in Python and to use Jupyter notebooks. This can be obtained by taking the course DSE200x, Python for Data Science.
Familiarity with calculus, especially derivatives of single-variable and multivariate functions.
